I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The HTML structure was valid, and the Tailwind CSS configuration appeared to be set up properly, but certain classes, especially those involving complex modifiers or pseudo-classes, were simply being ignored by the browser.  Inspecting the rendered HTML showed that the classes weren't even present in the `class` attribute of the elements.
